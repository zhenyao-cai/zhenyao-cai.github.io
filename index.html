            <h2 class="section-title">Research Interests</h2>
              <p>As a lifelong learner myself, I benefit from the knowledge I encounter daily and contribute what I know and learnt back to the community. My research is driven by the question:</p>

              <p class="research-question">
                How do people <span class="action-word">create</span>, <span class="action-word">communicate</span>, and <span class="action-word">construct knowledge</span> as both <span class="role-word">learners</span> and <span class="role-word">contributors</span> within and beyond classrooms?
              </p>

              <p>In a rapidly changing digital world, I focus on how emerging technologies, such as AI, reshape these fundamental practices. Right now, my research focuses on three areas:</p>

              <p>1. Developing theoretical understanding of how AI functions as a mediator and facilitator to reshape people's collaborative discourses.</p>


              <p>2. Designing interactive and effective curriculum to help novices learn how to be responsible media consumers and producers with AI.</p>

              <p>3. Generating design frameworks and strategies within tools themselves to help mitigate risks such as over-reliance and loss of creative agency.</p>
